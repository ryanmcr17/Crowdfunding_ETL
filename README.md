# Crowdfunding_ETL - Project #2 / 'mini project'

## .ipynb Jupyter notebook contains all Python code for reading data from .xlsx files, analyzing/cleaning/transforming the data via Pandas dataframes, and writing the results back to .csv files for loading into the SQL database

## .jpeg file shows image of ERD via QuickDBD, along with table/field details

## .sql file contains basic PostgreSQL code for creating a new schema and then creating the tables within it for loading .csv files that were output via Python code - confirmed within my own PGAdmin console that these work perfectly (.csv files load and queries return data as expected)

### /Resources folder contains initial .xlsx files provided along with resulting .csv files output via Python code in the Jupyter notebook
